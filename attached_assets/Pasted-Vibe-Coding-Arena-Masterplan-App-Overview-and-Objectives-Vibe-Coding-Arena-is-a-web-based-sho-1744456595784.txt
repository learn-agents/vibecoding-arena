Vibe Coding Arena – Masterplan

🧠 App Overview and Objectives

Vibe Coding Arena is a web-based showcase platform that compares the results of various AI coding agents (e.g., v0, Replit, Lovable, Bolt) when given the same prompts. It helps users visually evaluate how different agents interpret and build apps from identical inputs. The site is meant to be inspirational, educational, and shareable.

🎯 Target Audience

Indie developers

Founders and product builders

AI-curious makers and designers

Educators and tech enthusiasts evaluating AI tooling

✨ Core Features and Functionality

Homepage with 3 vertically stacked carousels

Each carousel corresponds to a specific prompt

Each carousel contains horizontally scrollable GIF cards

Each card includes:

GIF preview of a built web app

Agent name label (e.g., "v0", "Lovable")

Share button (copy link or social share)

No login required

No voting, no leaderboard (yet)

🛠 High-Level Tech Stack Recommendations

Frontend: Next.js or Astro (for performance), Tailwind CSS for styling

Backend: Optional for MVP (static site OK if content is fixed)

Hosting: Vercel, Netlify, or Cloudflare Pages

Assets: GIFs stored in a CDN or GitHub repo

Share links: Anchor tags or simple routing params

🧱 Conceptual Data Model

Prompt {
  id: string
  text: string
  carouselIndex: number
  agents: AgentResult[]
}

AgentResult {
  id: string
  promptId: string
  agentName: string
  gifUrl: string
  shareLink: string
}

🎨 User Interface Design Principles

Simple, clean layout

Mobile-friendly (horizontal carousels should be swipeable)

Large GIF previews, minimal text

No distraction: no voting, no sign-in

Clear labeling of AI agent per GIF

🔐 Security Considerations

No user data is collected

Make sure asset links are secure and CDN-hosted

Avoid dependency on third-party embeds

🚀 Development Phases

MVP

Static homepage with 3 carousels

GIFs hardcoded or loaded via JSON

Share button copies direct link

⚠️ Potential Challenges and Solutions

GIF hosting: Optimize file size, lazy load assets

Mobile UI: Ensure carousels are swipeable and smooth

Scalability: Start static, go dynamic only if needed
